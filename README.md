# RNN Encoder-Decoder for Sequence-to-Sequence Prediction

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to implement a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Encoder-Decoder model for sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks.

## Overview

The Encoder-Decoder RNN is a powerful architecture for problems where both the input and the output are sequences, such as machine translation, text summarization, and question answering.

The notebook `rnn_encoder_decoder.ipynb` contains a detailed walkthrough of implementing this model in Keras, including:

- Data preprocessing for sequence-to-sequence models.
- Building the encoder and decoder using Keras layers.
- Compiling and training the model.
- Using the trained model to make predictions.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you will need:

- Python 3
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab environment

## Usage

To use this notebook:

1. Ensure you have all the required software installed.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the `rnn_encoder_decoder.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
4. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and test the Encoder-Decoder model.

For more information on each step, please refer to the comments and instructions within the notebook.
